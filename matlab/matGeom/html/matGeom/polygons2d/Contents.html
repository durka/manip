   The 'polygons' module contains functions operating on shapes composed
   of a vertex list, like polygons or polylines.

   We call 'polyline' the curve defined by a series of vertices.
   A polyline can be either closed or open, depending on whether the last
   vertex is connected to the first one or not. This can be given as an
   option is some functions in the module.
   A 'polygon' is the planar domain delimited by a closed polyline. We
   sometimes want to consider 'complex polygons', whose boundary is
   composed of several disjoint domains. The domain defined by a single
   closed polyline is called 'simple polygon'.
   We call 'curve' a polyline with many vertices, such that the polyline
   can be considered as a discrete approximation of a &quot;real&quot; curve.

   A simple polygon or polyline is represented by a N-by-2 array, each row
   of the array representing the coordinates of a vertex. 
   Simple polygons are assumed to be closed, so there is no need to repeat
   the first vertex at the end. 
   As both polygons and polylines can be represented by a list of vertex
   coordinates, some functions also consider the vertex list itself. Such
   functions are prefixed by 'pointSet'. Also, many functions prefixed by
   'polygon' or 'polyline' works also on the other type of shape.

   For multiple-connected polygons, the different connected boundaries are
   separated by a row [NaN NaN].

   For some functions, the orientation of the polygon can be relevant: CCW
   stands for 'Conter-Clockwise' (positive orientation), CW stands for
   'Clockwise'.

   Polylines are parametrized in the following way:
   * the i-th vertex is located at position i-1
   * points of the i-th edge have positions ranging linearly from i-1 to i
   The parametrization domain for an open polyline is from 0 to Nv-1, and
   from 0 to Nv for a closed polyline (positions 0 and Nv correspond to
   the same point).

   Example:
   % Simple polygon:
   P1 = [1 1;2 1;2 2;1 2];
   drawPolygon(P1);
   axis([0 5 0 5]);
   % Multiple polygon:
   P2 = [10 10;40 10;40 40;10 40;NaN NaN;20 20;20 30;30 30;30 20];
   figure;drawPolygon(P2); axis([0 50 0 50]);
